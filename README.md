Lossless Compression
Lossless compression schemes compress the data without loss of information, and the original data can be recovered exactly from the compressed data

Dictionary techniques
In many applications, the output of the source consists of recurring patterns. A classic example is a text source in which certain patterns or words recur constantly. Also, there are certain patterns that simply do not occur, or if they do, occur with great rarity. A very reasonable approach to encoding such sources is to keep a list, or dictionary, of frequently occurring patterns. When these patterns appear in the source output, they are encoded with a reference to the dictionary

There are two types of dictionary

static dictionary
Choosing a static dictionary technique is most appropriate when considerable prior knowledge about the source is available. This technique is especially suitable for use in specific applications

adaptive dictionary
Choosing a adaptive dictionary technique is most appropriate when there is no prior knowledge about the source is available
