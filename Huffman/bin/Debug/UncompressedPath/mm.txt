importance of video communication. Data compression is one of the enabling
technologies for each of these aspects of the multimedia revolution. It would not be practical
to put images, let alone audio and video, on websites if it were not for data compression
algorithms. Cellular phones would not be able to provide communication with increasing
clarity were it not for compression. The advent of digital TV would not be possible without
compression. Data compression, which for a long time was the domain of a relatively small
group of engineers and scientists, is now ubiquitous. Make a long-distance call and you
are using compression. Use your modem, or your fax machine, and you will benefit from
compression. Listen to music on your mp3 player or watch a DVD and you are being
entertained courtesy of compression.
So, what is data compression, and why do we need it? Most of you have heard of IPEG
and MPEG, which are standards for representing images, video, and audio. Data compression
algorithms are used in these standards to reduce the number of bits required to represent
an image or a video sequence or music. In brief, data compression is the art or science
of representing information in a compact form. We create these compact representations
by identifying and using structures that exist in the data. Data can be characters in a text
file, numbers that are samples of speech or image waveforms, or sequences of numbers
that are generated by other processes. The reason we need data compression is that more
and more of the information that we generate and use is in digital form-in the form
of numbers represented by bytes of data. And the number of bytes required to represent
multimedia data can be huge. For example, in order to digitally represent 1 second of
video without compression (using the CCIR 601 format), we need more than 20 megabytes,
or 160 megabits. If we consider the number of seconds in a movie, we can easily see
why we would need compression. To represent 2 minutes of uncompressed CD-quality
